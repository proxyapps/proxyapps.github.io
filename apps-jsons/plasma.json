    "longdesc" : "PlasmaApp is a flexible implicit charge and energy conserving implicit PIC framework. This codes aims to demonstrate the potential of using a fluid plasma model to accelerate a kinetic model through a High-Low order system coupling. The multi-granularity of this problem gives it the ability to map well to emerging heterogeneous architectures with multiple levels of parallelism. Additionally this problem maps very well to very fine parallel architectures, such as GPUs, since the vast majority of the work is encapsulated in the particle system, a trivially parallel problem. This approach also has applicability to very large scale systems, potential exascale, due to the large amount of particle work per communication."
