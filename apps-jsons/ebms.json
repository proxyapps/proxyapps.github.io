    "longdesc" : "This is a miniapp for the Energy Banding Monte Carlo (EBMC) neutron transportation simulation code.  It is adapted from a similar miniapp provided by Andrew Siegel, whose algorithm is described in [1], where only one process in a compute node is used, and the compute nodes are divided into memory nodes and tracking nodes. Memory nodes do not participate in particle tracking. Obviously, there is a lot of resource waste in this design."
