    "longdesc" : "MiniFE is an proxy application for unstructured implicit finite element codes. It is similar to HPCCG and pHPCCG but provides a much more complete vertical covering of the steps in this class of applications. MiniFE also provides support for computation on multicore nodes, including pthreads and Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) for homogeneous multicore and CUDA for GPUs. Like HPCCG and pHPCCG, MiniFE is intended to be the “best approximation to an unstructured implicit finite element or finite volume application, but in 8000 lines or fewer.”"
